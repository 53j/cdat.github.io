* Summary
  * Some think we need to focus on use case 1 and 2 in the context of Paraview first and uses these to report quickly to sponsors and show great performance increase
  * Galen should be reporting soon with preliminary result on reading data in
  * There is a strong feeling that we need to think strong and hard on the design
  * seems that temporal/linear parallelization is the main thing we need to focus on for now
  * Should we come up with a vistrails/pythonic language/dialect ?
  * If we tweak the user scripting language, we need to come up with a translator
  * Need to keep the metadata around and pass them to Paraview
  * We should expect 50% of GUI-based users and 50% of scripting-based users
  * Everybody is going to look into more details at the CDAT specific
    use cases as well, see: [Parallelizing CDAT Core Use Cases]()
