## EOF2

eof2 is a package for performing EOF analysis on spatial-temporal data sets.    

The package was created to simplify the process of EOF analysis in the Python environment. Some of the key features are listed below:   

* Suitable for large data sets: computationally efficient for the large data sets typical of modern climate model output.
* Transparent handling of missing values: missing values are removed automatically when computing EOFs and re-inserted into output fields.
* Automatic meta-data: meta-data from input fields is used to construct output meta-data.
* No Fortran dependencies: written in Python using the power of numpy, no compilers required.
