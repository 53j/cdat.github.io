##Use case 8
###Computing a zonal mean
**Use Case**: Computing a zonal mean    
**Actor**: Climate/Data Scientist    
**Background**: most fields have a strong latitudinal component and it can be easier to look at them once it has been zonally averaged.    
**Use Scenario**: 

1. identify need file(s) to cover time period
2. identify "zonal" dimension (longitude)
3. average over "zonal" dim
4. dump out result

**Difficulties**:     
**Possible variation**: Use level instead of longitude average    
**Frequency**: Medium    
**Criticality**: Medium    
**Risk**: Medium
