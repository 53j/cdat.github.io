### X Window System from ORNL to Other Sites
The UV-CDAT GUI makes extensive use of the X Window System.   Over long
distances, a plain X WIndow System may encounter network latency issues
which slow it down to the point of un-usability.   For serving UV-CDAT
windows from Oak Ridge at Lawrence Livermore, we have seen NX almost
eliminate this problem.  The following tips have been tested on only one
machine, rhea.ccs.ornl.gov, but should work with other Oak Ridge
machines, at least.    

To install a Free NX client (also known as the NoMachine player) on your
desktop computer, follow the instructions at    

    https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/using-nx-on-home/.

These instructions are a little outdated, but good enough so that it is
easy to figure out what to do.  When you get the key with curl, add the
-k option.  That is,    

    curl -k -o home.key https://users.nccs.gov/~csep99/home.key

The NX client has lots of special keystroke commands.  Just remember
Ctrl-Alt-0.  This will give you a menu which you can use to make the
window adjustments you will probably need.    

The NX client may become unresponsive if you run emacs in its own X
window.  The solution is simple - run Emacs inside a terminal window by
unsetting DISPLAY.  (There is no problem with running UV-CDAT in its own
X window.)
