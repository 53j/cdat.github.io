<h2 id="new">Welcome to UV-CDAT!</h2>

New here? Don't worry! We'll help you get started. If you're interested in what you can do with UV-CDAT, you can take a look at our [gallery]. If you're interested in anything you see there, you can look into getting our application [installed][install].

<h2 id="help">We'll give you a hand.</h2>

Having trouble with something? We've got a great community of people who can give you a hand on our [support] email list.

<h2 id="contribute">We're on GitHub!</h2>

If you want to get to know us, you can come chat with us on our [developer mail list][dev]. If you want to get up to speed with the project, our [wiki] is kept up-to-date with what you need to get going.

<h2 id="info">The UV-CDAT Project</h2>
<p>
UV-CDAT builds on the following key technologies:
<ol>
  <li>The Climate Data Analysis Tools (CDAT) framework developed at LLNL for the analysis, visualization, and management of large-scale distributed climate data;</li>
  <li>ParaView: an open-source, multi-platform, parallel-capable visualization tool with recently added capabilities to better support specific needs of the climate-science community;</li>
  <li>VisTrails, an open-source scientific workflow and provenance management system that supports data exploration and visualization;</li>
  <li>VisIt: an open-source, parallel-capable, visual-data exploration and analysis tool that is capable of running on a diverse set of platforms, ranging from laptops to the Department of Energy's largest supercomputers.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>

These combined tools, along with others such as the R open-source statistical
analysis and plotting software and custom packages (e.g. vtDV3D), form UV-CDAT
and provide a synergistic approach to climate modeling, allowing researchers to
advance scientific visualization of large-scale climate data sets. The UV-CDAT
framework couples powerful software infrastructures through two primary means:

<ol>
  <li>Tightly coupled integration of the CDAT Core with the VTK/ParaView infrastructure to provide high-performance, parallel-streaming data analysis and visualization of massive climate-data sets (other tighly coupled tools include
  VCS, VisTrails, DV3D, and ESMF/ESMP);</li>
  <li>Loosely coupled integration to provide the flexibility of using tools quickly
  in the infrastructure such as ViSUS, VisIt, R, and MatLab for data analysis and
  visualization as well as to apply customized data analysis applications within
  an integrated environment.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Within both paradigms, UV-CDAT will provide data-provenance capture and
mechanisms to support data analysis via the VisTrails infrastructure.
