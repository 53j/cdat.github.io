##windspharm

windspharm is a package for computing quantities derived from global wind fields using spherical harmonics.    

windspharm provides a user-friendly interface for vector wind computations on the sphere (e.g., divergence, streamfunction etc.). The package is a replacement for the windfield package (windfield was based on the sphere module, which is now deprecated). windspharm is a completely new package based on the more up-to-date pyspharm module.    

Documentation for windspharm is available at [http://ajdawson.github.com/windspharm/](http://ajdawson.github.com/windspharm/)
