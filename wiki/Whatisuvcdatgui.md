##What is the UV-CDAT GUI?

It is the official Graphical User Interface (GUI) for  The Ultra-scale Visualization Climate Analysis Tools (UV-CDAT). Pronounced as u-v-c-dat, it greatly simplifies the use of UV-CDAT and can be used with no knowledge of Python or any programming language. This GUI is highly recommended for beginners.    

Layout of the GUI:    

UV-CDAT GUI was designed to be used from left-to-right and top-to-bottom Has on-line help balloons to assist the user in navigating through the interface Users can customize the GUI to their specifications. Most tasks are grouped into "tabs" categories.    

UV-CDAT script-learning tool translates every button press and keystroke into a Python script file.    

Command line instructions and logs are premitted via the calculator tab.    

The GUI also allows non-interactive repetition of common tasks.    

Built-in Climate Analysis Tools:

* General utility  modules for scientific computing
* Miscellaneous routines for manipulating variables
* Numerical computation on multi-dimensional arrays
* Visualize and Control Variable Output:
* Display data in a range of graphical output
* Annotate and control the visual output
* Dynamic control of animation output

**Note some features are still under development and may not be implemented yet.**
