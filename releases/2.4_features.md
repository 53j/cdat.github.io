# 2.4 Release New Features

We've got 4 significant updates in the 2.4 release:

1. [Color Management](#color-management)
2. [Patterns/Hatches](#patterns-hatches)
3. [Canvas and Output Sizing](#canvas-and-output-sizing)
4. [Continents Styling](#continents-styling)

For a quick reference of all examples in this announcement, check out [this page in the gallery](http://uvcdat.llnl.gov/gallery.html#2.4).

## Color Management

It's been a bit difficult to manually specify colors in VCS; you have to memorize the index of colors you want out of the 255-color colormap, and have "magic" numbers sprinkled throughout your code wherever you reference a color. That system will remain in place (backwards compatibility is very important to us), but [@doutriaux1](https://github.com/doutriaux1) majorly reworked the color logic throughout VCS to make it substantially more user-friendly.

We now support [X11 color names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_color_names), RGBA, and RGB color assignment, which you can [check out in the gallery](http://uvcdat.llnl.gov/examples/color.html).

[Colormaps now use RGBA values as well](http://uvcdat.llnl.gov/examples/rgba_colormap.html)!

Also, you can now [use any matplotlib colormap](http://uvcdat.llnl.gov/examples/matplotlib_colormaps.html)!

## Patterns/Hatches

![Pattern/Hatch Reference](http://uvcdat.llnl.gov/gallery/fullsize/pattern_chart.png)

At long last, we've closed issue #541 (Thanks for being patient, [@jypeter](https://github.com/jypeter)!). Patterns and hatches are available for `boxfill`s, `isofill`s, `meshfill`s, and `fillarea`s.

### Pattern/Hatches Concepts

`fillarea` provides a simple way to introduce the concepts of patterns and hatches. The `fillarea` object is a secondary graphics method, for those who aren't familiar with it. It allows you to provide a series of points, and will create a filled area styled to your specifications.

There are three attributes that are relevant to Patterns and Hatches for `fillarea`s.

* `style`
    * `solid`
        * The default; renders a solid color.
    * `pattern`
        * A black pattern
    * `hatch`
        * A pattern with the color determined by the `color` attribute of the fillarea
* `index`
    * The pattern to use
    * Accepts 1-20
    * Refer to the chart above
* `opacity`
    * Controls the transparency of the pattern/color
    * A float between 0 and 100

For primary graphics methods (Boxfill, Isofill, Meshfill), you use these attributes:

* `fillareastyle`
    * Matches with `style` above. Accepts `hatch` (colored pattern), `pattern` (black pattern), or `solid` (no pattern, the default)
* `fillareaindices`
    * Matches with `index` in the examples above. Accepts a list of integers between 1 and 20; refer to the chart above to know what patterns to expect for what index. You provide one index per level in your plot.
* `fillareaopacity`
    * Matches with `opacity` in the examples above. Accepts a list of floats between 1 and 100. You provide one opacity value per level in your plot.

However, if you're going to use these, you're also going to have to specify levels for the graphics method. Normally, the graphics method will determine levels based off of the values at the current time slice; when you want to control the appearance of those levels, you need to specify them manually. For `clt`, we can just use a range from 0 to 100 at increments of 20.

> **Important Note:**
>
> `levels` describes the bounds of ranges, whereas `fillareaindices` and `fillareacolors`
> both describe the ranges themselves. You need one more level than indices or colors.

* [Boxfill Pattern/Hatch](http://uvcdat.llnl.gov/examples/boxfill_pattern.html)

* [Meshfill Pattern/Hatch](http://uvcdat.llnl.gov/examples/meshfill_pattern.html)

## Canvas and Output Sizing

We've done some touch-up to the process of sizing your canvas in VCS.

### Default Behavior

```python
import vcs
canvas = vcs.init()
canvas.open()
```

This should create a window that is a reasonable size for your monitor.

### Custom Sizing

If you want a specific size, you can pass in arguments to either `vcs.init()` *or* `canvas.open()`, like so:

```python
import vcs

canvas1 = vcs.init(geometry={"width":1200, "height":800})
canvas1.open()

canvas2 = vcs.init(geometry=(1200, 800))
canvas2.open()

canvas3 = vcs.init()
canvas3.open(width=1200, height=800)
```

Widths and heights passed to `canvas.open()` will override the geometry passed in to `vcs.init()`.

### Sizing Output

If you call `canvas.png` with only a filename as an argument, you'll get your output in the same dimensions as the canvas.

```python
import vcs
canvas = vcs.init(geometry=(300, 200))
canvas.open()
canvas.png("test")
```

But if you want to size the output to a different size, you can pass in `height` and `width` keyword arguments to the `canvas.png` function.

```python
import vcs
canvas = vcs.init(geometry=(600, 400))
canvas.open()
canvas.png("test", width=800, height=500)
```

> **Important Note:**
>
> `vcs` will attempt to keep image dimensions as portrait or landscape, depending on the current size of your canvas.
> This means that if you call `canvas.png("file", width=600, height=300)` but your canvas' dimensions are `500` x `800`,
> your output will be `300` x `600`.

## Continents Styling

![Styled Continents](http://uvcdat.llnl.gov/gallery/fullsize/continents_line.png)

You can now specify the appearance of continents using the vcs `line` primitive and the `continents_line` keyword of the `canvas.plot` function. A simple example can be found [here](http://uvcdat.llnl.gov/examples/continents_line.html)
